Notes from Copilot:
- Use diagrams everywhere (draw.io, Excalidraw, Lucidchart).
- Keep all configs sanitised (no real IPs, keys, usernames).
- Use consistent naming conventions.
- Add badges (e.g., “Python”, “Terraform”, “AWS”).
- Use Markdown tables for clarity.
- Include a short “What I learned” section in each project.



To figure out:
- A VM resource allocation plan (RAM/CPU per VM across all machines)
- A network diagram ready for draw.io
- A step‑by‑step build order for assembling the entire lab
- A pfSense VLAN + firewall rule plan
- A Proxmox + desktop hypervisor split plan
- A backup + snapshot strategy
