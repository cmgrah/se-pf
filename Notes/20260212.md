I've had trouble using pfSense on the 7070. I wanted to use it as a single NIC device but the netowrk topology was too complicated. Instead I am now pivoting to using the ODROID as the firewall as it has 2 NICs and I can install pfSsense or OPNsense on it.

So I tried that. Install was fine for both. The issue is the chipset of the NICs on the ODROID H2+ is RTL8125B. These drivers are not compatible with FreeBSD, which is what pfSense and OPNSense are built on...

I explored options to but new hardware. I think I have enough and I don't really want to purchase more. One solution someone shared on a reddit post somewhere is to intall the realtek-re-kmod. The issue is that without a usable NIC, 1. pfSense cannot boot, and 2. OPNSense boots, but cannot access the internet. I have a USB-C Ethernet adaptor I can try, using it to get and install the drivers, then see how OPNSense goes with the new drivers.

Another option is to virtualise pfSense/OPNSense on the ODROID, and let the host OS handle the drivers. This will be a good fallback. If I do this I will install proxmox on the ODROID.

Then the topology will be more standard:
[WAN] --> [Router] --> ([fw WAN Port]->[fw LAN Port]) --> [Switch] --> (Everything else)
