Ok so adding the VLANs to the switch has been tiring and confusing. Lost access a number of times but as everything is within reach, I can recover.

The plan I think has changed a bit but not a lot. My architecture is complicated. Having VMs on Unraid going and sending multiple VLANs to 1 port on the switch is not as simple as I had hoped.

So I have Pihole (10.20.0.5) accessible via CAM-DESK (10.10.0.20) - GUI, ICMP, and DNS. I want to get it accessible via the general "home" lan too - that is, the network from the router to OPNSense.

I have a WIFI card on my desktop which helps to troubleshoot but that is not really the issue. It's the VLANs.
Adding VLANs on this Netgear GS108Ev3 switch is confusing. "Prosumer" was what I saw one reddit post refer to it as.

Next thing is to focus on getting the DNS working for the "home lan". At that point I'll be at square one - where I started (but without an Ubuntu jumpbox... RIP).

I'll keep going. Maybe I should consider a serious switch... or maybe this is fine until I get the concepts under my belt.
