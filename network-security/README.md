# Network Security

This project focuses on network architecture, firewall configuration, intrusion detection, and traffic analysis.

## Objectives
- Build a segmented virtual network aligned with zero trust principles.
- Configure pfSense firewall rules and validate traffic flows.
- Deploy Suricata IDS and tune detection rules.
- Analyse network traffic using Wireshark.

## Contents 
- 'pfsense-config/' - Sanitised firewall configuration.
- 'suricata-rules/' - Custom and tuned IDS rules.
- 'wireshark-analysis.md' - Packet capture analysis.
- 'network-segmentation-diagram.png' - Network architecture diagram.

## Capabilities Demonstrated
- Network segementation and access control.
- Firewall rule design and justification.
- IDS aler triage and rule tuning.
- Protocol-level analysis of captured traffic.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Ability to reason about network flows and trust boundaries.
- Understanding of how to detect and interpret suspicious activity.
- Practivalk experience with defensive network tooling.
