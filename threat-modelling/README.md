# Threat Modelling

This project aims to demonstrate security engineering analysis using structured threat modelling techniques. It includes a data flow diagram (DFD), STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)-based threat identification, and mitigation recommendations.

## Objectives
- Analyse a representative system using industry-standard threat modelling methods.
- Identify threats across trust boundaries.
- Produce actionable mitigation strategies aligned with secure-by-design principles.

## Contents
- 'system-data-flow-diagram.png' - High-level DFD of analysed system.
- 'threat-model.md' - STRIDE analysis and threat enumeration.
- 'mitigations.md' - Recommended controls and architectural improvements.

## Methodology
- Data flow diagramming to identify assets, processes, and trust boundaries.
- STRIDE categorisation to ensure comprehensive threat coverage.
- Mapping mitigation to security principles such as least privilege, defence in depth, ans secure defaults.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Ability to reason about system behaviour and attack surfaces.
- Understanding of how to translate abstract threats into concrete engineering controls.
- Familiarity with ASD Essential Eight alignment where applicable.
