# Vulnerability Asessment

This project demonstrates vulnerability scanning, triage, and remediation planning useing industry-standard tools.

## Objectives
- Perform vulnerability scans against lab systmes.
- Validate findings and eliminate false positives.
- Prioritise vulnerabilites using risk-based criteria.
- Produce strucutred remediation plan.

# Contents
- 'scan-results/' - Sanitised scan outputs.
- 'triage-report.md' - Analysis of findings and prioritisation.
- 'remediation-plan.md' - Recommended fixes and timelines.

## Methodology
- Scnning using Nessus Essential or OpenVAS.
- Manual validation of high-impact findings.
- CVSS scoring and contextual risk assessment.
- Mapping remediation actions to secure baselines.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Ability to interpret scanner output with engineering judgement.
- Understanding of exploit chains and risk prioritisation.
- Experience producing professional assurance documentation.
