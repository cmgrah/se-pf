# Cloud Security

This project demonstrates secure cloud architectur design, identity and access management, logging configuration, and network security in Azure and AWS.

## Objectives
- Deply a secure cloud environment following least privilege principles.
- Configure IAM roles, policies, and identity boundaries.
- Implement logging and monitoring using native cloud services.
- Build a secure VPC/Vnet with appropriate segmentation.

## Contents
- 'iam-policies/' - Example least-privilege IAM policies.
- 'secure-vpc-architecture.png' - Cloud network architectur diagram.
- 'cloudtrail-loggin-setupmd' - Logging and monitoring configuration.
- 'terraform/' - infrastructure-as-a-code templates.

## Security Controls Implemented
- IAM role seperation and policy scoping.
- CloudTrail & Azure Monitor logging.
- Encrypted storage and key management.
- Network ACLs, security groups, and subnet design.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of cloud-native security controls.
- Ability to design secure architecture with ASD cloud guidance.
- Experience implementing least privilege and secure deployment patterns.
